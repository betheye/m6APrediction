Description: Provides functions to predict N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA 
    modification sites using a pre-trained random forest model. The package 
    includes tools for single and multiple sample predictions based on sequence 
    features such as GC content, RNA type, RNA region, and evolutionary 
    conservation scores.
