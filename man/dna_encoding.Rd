\title{Encode DNA Sequences into Numerical Features}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector containing DNA sequences of equal length}
}
\value{
A data frame where each column represents a nucleotide position,
with factor levels A, T, C, G
}
\description{
This function converts DNA sequences into a data frame with each nucleotide
position as a separate factor column. It is used internally for feature
engineering in the m6A prediction pipeline.
