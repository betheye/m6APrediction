\title{Multiple Sample Prediction for m6A Sites}
\usage{
prediction_multiple(ml_fit, feature_df, positive_threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{ml_fit}{A trained random forest model object (e.g., from randomForest package)}

\item{feature_df}{A data frame containing the following required columns:
gc_content, RNA_type, RNA_region, exon_length, distance_to_junction,
evolutionary_conservation, and DNA_5mer}

\item{positive_threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 for classification
threshold. Sites with probability above this value are classified as
"Positive" (default: 0.5)}
}
\value{
A data frame with two additional columns: predicted_m6A_prob
(the predicted probability) and predicted_m6A_status (either "Positive"
or "Negative" based on the threshold)
}
\description{
This function predicts m6A modification sites for multiple samples using
a pre-trained random forest model. It takes a data frame of features and
returns predictions with probability scores.
}
\examples{
# Load the pre-trained random forest model
ml_fit <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "rf_fit.rds", package = "m6APrediction"))

# Load example input data
example_df <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "m6A_input_example.csv",
                                    package = "m6APrediction"))

# Make predictions for multiple samples
predictions <- prediction_multiple(ml_fit, example_df, positive_threshold = 0.6)

# View the first few predictions
head(predictions)
